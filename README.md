# Sorting Algorithms: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bubble Sort

Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science, and several algorithms are available for this purpose. In this README, we'll explore three common sorting algorithms: **Selection Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, and **Bubble Sort**, and provide simple C++ implementations for each.

## Selection Sort

**Selection Sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the list and moves it to the beginning. Here's a brief overview of how to perform Selection Sort in C++:

1. **Iterate Through the List**: Start with the first element as the minimum.
2. **Find the Minimum**: Compare the minimum with the elements that follow and update the minimum as needed.
3. **Swap with the First Element**: Once the minimum is found, swap it with the first element in the unsorted portion.
4. **Repeat**: Continue this process for the remaining unsorted portion until the entire list is sorted.

## Insertion Sort

**Insertion Sort** is another simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It takes each element and inserts it into its correct position within the sorted portion of the array. Here's a brief overview of how to perform Insertion Sort in C++:

1. **Iterate Through the List**: Start with the second element as the current element to be inserted.
2. **Compare and Insert**: Compare the current element with the elements in the sorted portion and insert it in the correct position.
3. **Repeat**: Continue this process for all elements until the entire list is sorted.

## Bubble Sort

**Bubble Sort** is a basic sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. Here's a brief overview of how to perform Bubble Sort in C++:

1. **Iterate Through the List**: Start at the beginning of the list.
2. **Compare and Swap**: Compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order.
3. **Repeat**: Continue this process for multiple passes until the list is sorted.
